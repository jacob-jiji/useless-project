## Team Details

**Team Name:** Querty  
**Team Lead:** Jacob Jiji - Adi Shankara Engineering College

## Overview

An advanced eye and head tracking system that lets you control a Chrome Dino game using only your eye movements and head gestures, because using your hands is apparently too mainstream.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People were getting way too much exercise using their fingers to press spacebar while playing the Chrome Dino game. Also, keyboards were feeling neglected and underutilized during gaming sessions.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a sophisticated computer vision system that tracks your face and eye movements in real-time, allowing you to jump, crouch, and slow down the dino using only your gaze and head movements. Now you can play games while looking like you're having an intense staring contest with your screen!
